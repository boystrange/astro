# My astrophtography journal

When you become passionate about an hobby, astrophotography in this case, you
want to do it all the time. Since I live in a place where most nights are cloudy
or foggy, I had to find an alternative way to "do astrophotography" in at least
some of those nights as well. This journal is meant to be just that. Here I'll
post pictures and describe detailed processing workflows for the targets I
shoot.
